# Sudoku Solver

This project is a simple project to demonstrate the use of classes in javascript. The problem being solved is an
attempt to solve sudoku puzzles. The user is presented a grid with cells containing all possible values. As they
enter values, the possible values of each cell are recalculated, eventually resulting in the puzzle being solved.

The main javascript objects being defimed include:
* Grid
* Cell
* CellValue

Unfortunately there was not need for object inheritence, so this example does not demonstrate that ability.
